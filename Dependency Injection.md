 Dependency Injection and the Factory Pattern are related concepts in software design, but they serve different purposes and have distinct implementations. Let's clarify their differences:

 Dependency Injection (DI):
 Dependency Injection is a design principle where the responsibility of creating objects (dependencies) is shifted from the client code to an external entity. The core idea is to inject (provide) the required dependencies into a class rather than having the class create them itself. This promotes loose coupling between components, enhances testability, and makes the codebase more modular.
 In DI, the objects (dependencies) are typically provided through constructor injection, method injection, or property injection. The responsibility of creating and managing the instances of these dependencies is usually delegated to a DI container or framework.

 Factory Pattern:
 The Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface (or an abstract class) for creating objects of various related classes. It allows you to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. This pattern encapsulates the object creation logic, making it easier to manage and maintain.
 A Factory can be used to create objects with specific configurations or to encapsulate complex object creation processes. It provides a clear separation between object creation and usage.

 Differences:
 The key differences between Dependency Injection and the Factory Pattern are:

 Purpose:
 DI's primary focus is on managing and providing dependencies to a class. It's about making a class aware of its dependencies without creating them. The Factory Pattern's primary focus is on abstracting the process of object creation. It encapsulates the logic of creating objects of various related types.

 Responsibility:
 In DI, the responsibility of creating and providing dependencies is often handed over to a container or framework. In the Factory Pattern, the responsibility of creating objects is given to specialized factory classes.

 Usage:
 DI is used to ensure that a class receives its required dependencies from the outside, promoting modularity and easier testing. The Factory Pattern is used to create objects based on a common interface or abstract class, abstracting the creation process.

 Dependency Injection is a broader concept that focuses on dependency management, while the Factory Pattern specifically addresses the creation of objects. While they can be used together in some cases (e.g., using a factory to provide instances through dependency injection), they have distinct purposes and implementations.
